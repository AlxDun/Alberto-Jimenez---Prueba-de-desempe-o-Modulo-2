The page can be started from any of the HTML files, but the main and first one is "presentation - main.html".
In the page you can see a header with a navigation bar with three buttos followed by a brief presentation of myself.
If you click on any of the buttons, the page with the corresponding information will open.

Porfolio:
The portfolio section will open when you click the corresponding button and will show a brief summary of my technical skills and a couple of projects I have worked on.

Contact:
The same thing happens with the contact section, the corresponding page opens when you click the button and a small window will be displayed with some inputs that ask for a name, an email and a message respectively and below a button to "send" the information, followed by two buttons, one that opens my github and another that opens my discord to contact us through those means.
